# 🧮 Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

This project is an exercise from the **freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python** course.  
It implements a function `calculate()` in **NumPy** that computes the following for a 3x3 matrix:  

- Mean  
- Variance  
- Standard deviation  
- Maximum  
- Minimum  
- Sum  

The function returns these values for each **axis (rows & columns)** and the **flattened matrix** in a dictionary format.  
It raises a `ValueError` if the input list has fewer than 9 elements.  

The project includes unit tests in `test_module.py` to validate the solutions.
